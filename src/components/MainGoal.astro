      No, the “Canvas & Code” concept—positioning web design as a collaborative,
      artistic process tailored specifically for creatives—is relatively niche
      and underused.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, a handful of designers do operate in adjacent spaces (e.g.,
      studio brands targeting indie artists or feminine brands), but your unique
      blend of handmade feel + custom digital artistry gives you a strong point
      of differentiation.

      Custom digital artistry refers to the practice of crafting digital
      designs—like websites, illustrations, or interfaces—that are:

    <ul>
      <!-- <h2>1. Highly Personalized</h2> -->
      <li>Tailored to the client’s creative style, voice, and aesthetic</li>
      <li>Informed by the client’s artwork, medium, or story</li>
      <li>"What separates web developers from Ai? Human innovation!</li>
      <li>
        Avoids templates and generic layouts in favor of expressive, unique
        design elements
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <!-- <h2>2.Artistically Driven</h2> -->
      <li>
        Prioritizes mood, composition, and visual storytelling over corporate
        polish
      </li>
      <li>
        Often includes hand-drawn elements, textures, painterly color palettes,
        or collage-style layouts
      </li>
      <li>
        Draws inspiration from fine art, zines, sketchbooks, journals, or
        craftwork
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <!-- <h2>3. Crafted in Code</h2> -->
      <li>
        Combines the fluidity of visual art with the structure of web
        development
      </li>
      <li>Responsive and functional, but emotionally resonant and "alive"</li>
      <li>
        May include interactive touches like hover effects, transitions, or
        animations that feel whimsical or tactile
      </li>
    </ul>

        So when you say you offer custom digital artistry, you're saying:
      </span>“I don’t just build websites—I co-create digital experiences that
      feel like an extension of your creative work, using thoughtful design,
      expressive visuals, and personal attention.”
