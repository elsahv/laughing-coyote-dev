  CURRENT NOTES: ON ‘CREATE YOUR OFFER’ VID

find your niche-”LC- target demand would be rich artists in the area, think of 60-year-old high deserter who has no time or patience for websites”

free value blog: tech assistance to senior citizens.??

-”reason not to work for free: a customer who pays is more invested in the business project, as opposed to a free customer”

- KEY MINDSHIFT SHIFTS:
- avoid the “too many options on the menu, also betraying yourself as the budget option”

- two types of clients: one who wants a dance monkey, or one who are happy to pay expert prices for long standing results”

- ”your brand isn’t built alone in your bedroom, but through collaboration with your audience.”

??make the first 1/2 of website a different color scheme than the second half. Both halves should blend into the other ??maybe opposite color schemes?
